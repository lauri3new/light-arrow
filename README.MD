## light-arrow

Light arrow is a small library for type safe asynchronous programming in typescript. The library is based around the functional data structures TaskEither and Arrow. TaskEither describes asynchronous operations that can succeed or fail. Arrows are data structures that describe asynchronous operations that can succeed or fail that have some dependencies. Please visit the documentation https://lauri3new.github.io/light-arrow-docs/ for a longer explanation and some examples. These data types won't actually perform any operation until the run method is called, this means that TaskEithers and Arrows have the desirable property of being referentially transparent. By delaying execution until the run method is called, the Arrow data type provides a nice way to perform dependency injection as we can group all the dependencies of the program into a single object type and provide test and production implementations of these in the run method as we wish.

As well as the TaskEither and Arrow data types this module exposes helper functions for building type safe http apps using the express framework. Please see this section https://lauri3new.github.io/light-arrow-docs/docs/HttpApp of the documentation for more detail.
